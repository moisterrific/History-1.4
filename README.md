# History
 
 supports block/wall swaps by treating them as individual tile/wall removal and placement. Also supports giving users the ability to rollback their own tiles because i was too lazy to remove it. also includes /h and /rb as aliases.
 i didnt actually test whether i properly ported it out of my custom shit so this might be completely broke :)
 
different permissions:\
/rollback - history.rollback.self & history.rollback.others\
/reenact - same as above\
/rundo - history.rollback.self
